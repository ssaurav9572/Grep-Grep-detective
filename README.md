Grep is the sort of UNIX magic I have always wanted to learn. Since grep is all about regular expressions I would have to learn that first. This was actually quite difficult because grep uses the POSIX Basic Regular Expressions, which is not that common. The Wikipedia entry was a lifesaver. Besides that, I also used the man page for grep as a reference.

For the project, I thought that a fun idea might be to create a detective game. In the game, you get a folder full of files, and itâ€™s your job to extract information. I called the game Grep detective.
